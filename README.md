# HierMic

Are you annoyed that WO Mic isn't working on linux at all??
Then HierMic *might* be a nice replacment for it.

Use your phone as a wireless microphone over WiFi. Audio is streamed to a Linux device and injected into PipeWire as a real virtual microphone source.

---

## Requirements

**Server (Linux PC):**
- PipeWire with PulseAudio compatibility layer running:
  ```bash
  systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-pulse
  ```
- `pactl` in PATH (usually from `libpulse` / `pipewire-pulse` package)

**Mobile (iOS or Android):**
- iOS 14+ or Android 6+
- Same WiFi network as the server

---

## Server: quick start

### Option A: download the binary

Grab the latest `hiermic` from [Releases](https://github.com/Kizuren/hiermic/releases) and run it:

```bash
chmod +x ./hiermic
./hiermic
```

### Option B: install as a systemd user service

```bash
./hiermic--install
```

This copies the binary to `~/.local/bin/hiermic`, writes a systemd user unit, and starts the service automatically. It will also auto-start on login.

```bash
# Check status
systemctl --user status hiermic

# View live logs
journalctl --user -u hiermic -f

# Uninstall
hiermic --uninstall
```

### Option C: build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kizuren/hiermic
cd hiermic/server
dotnet run --project src/HierMic.Server
```

## Mobile app

### iOS (sideload)

Download the unsigned IPA `HierMic-unsigned.ipa` from [Releases](https://github.com/kizuren/hiermic/releases) and install it via [AltStore](https://altstore.io), [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) or [LiveContainer](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer).

### Build from source (iOS / Android)

```bash
cd mobile/hiermic_app
flutter pub get
flutter run          # Android / connected device
```

For iOS, use the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/ios-build.yml) since it produces an unsigned IPA without needing a Mac or Apple Developer account.

---

## Usage

1. Start the server (or have it running via systemd)
2. Open the HierMic app on your phone
3. The server appears automatically via mDNS, tap it to connect
4. If auto-discovery doesn't work, enter the server IP manually (`192.168.x.x`)
5. Tap the mic button to start streaming
6. Select **hiermic** as your microphone source in OBS, Discord, etc.

## Protocol

| Channel | Port | Format |
|---------|------|--------|
| Control | TCP 7878 | Newline-delimited JSON (`Hello` / `HelloAck` / `Start` / `Stop` / `Ping` / `Pong`) |
| Audio   | UDP 7879 | Binary: `seq[4] + ts[4] + channels[1] + sampleCount[2] + PCM16LE data` |
| Discovery | mDNS | Service type `_hiermic._tcp` |

Audio format: PCM 16-bit little-endian, 48 000 Hz, mono (~1.5 Mbps).

---

## Notes

- No jitter buffer, audio may stutter on congested WiFi
- PCM only, Opus codec is not implemented yet
- The IPA is unsigned, so you will need AltStore, SideStore or LiveContainer to use it on a non-jailbroken device.
- This project was unfortunately mostly vibecoded since I needed an easy and similar alternative to WO Mic

## Why this name?
You can read `WO Mic` as `Where Mic` in german. So I thought of naming it `hier mic` which means translated `here mic` :D
